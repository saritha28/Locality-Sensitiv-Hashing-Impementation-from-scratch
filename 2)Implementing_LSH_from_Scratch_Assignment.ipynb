        "  6. We have set the **numpy random seed to zero**, please do not change it. And then you can make use of **np.random.normal** to generate the vectors for hyperplanes.\n",

        "  13. **In case of a tie** in the obtained labels from nearest neighbours, you can pick a label after sorting all the labels **alphabetically**(A-Z), i.e. for example labels starting with A would get more preference than labels starting with Z.\n",

        "  15. Note that there are a total of 10 data points in the test data so the final list you return should be of length 10.\n",
        "  16. Also note that the cosine similarity function should be written from scratch, you should not directly make use of existing libraries.\n",
        "  17. Please use the formula of cosine similarity as explained in the course videos, you can make use of numpy or scipy to calculate dot or norm or transpose."
